Saanvi: Circle class, Triangle class, Fractral Drawer(drawCircleFractral)

How to complie/run: To run the program, use a code editor application such as VS Code or IntelliJ. When the program is run, it will prompt the user to type in triangle, rectangle or circle, and the user should input the shape accordingly. A fractral drawing of the shape should pop up in a separate window. To exit the program, simply close this pop up window.

Assumptions: We assume that the user will type in the shape with all lowercase letters and spell the shape correctly. If the user doesn't do this, a window with a blank canvas screen will pop up, and the user will have to close this separate window to exit the program.

Additional Features: We implemented a Random module in the drawRectangleFractral, drawCircleFractal and drawTrianagleFactral methods, which allows each shape that is created to be a different color. 

Known defect: User may have to resize the canvas screen (enlarge it) to see the full fractral drawing.
